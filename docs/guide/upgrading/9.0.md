# Upgrading from 8.x to 9.x

## Get new assets, clear cache

This is true for every update: be sure to grab the latest assets and to clear the view cache:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=assets
php artisan view:clear
```

## Deprecated methods have been removed

- Entity List: deprecated `buildListFields()` and `buildListLayout()` were removed, use `buildList()` instead

## Config is now required for custom menu / login images

If you have added `/public/sharp-assets/menu-icon.png` and/or `/public/sharp-assets/login-icon.png` images, you must ensure the path is defined in the `config/sharp.php` config file:
```php
// config/sharp.php

return [
    // [...]
    
    'theme' => [
        'primary_color' => ...,
        'logo_urls' => [
            'menu' => '/public/sharp-assets/menu-icon.png',
            'login' => '/public/sharp-assets/login-icon.png',
        ],
    ],
];
```

## New middlewares to declare

Due to migration to inertia, two middlewares must be added to the `sharp.middleware.web` config:

```php
// config/sharp.php

return [
    'middleware' => [
        //...
        'web' => [
            // ...
            \Code16\Sharp\Http\Middleware\HandleSharpErrors::class,
            \Code16\Sharp\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests::class,
        ],
    ],
]
```

## Page Alerts (aka global messages) need a substantial rewrite 

This part has been entirely rewritten, and will need substantial changes in your code.

In 8.x and below, you were asked to configure page alerts in the `buildConfig()` method; and if your page alert was displaying dynamic data, you had to use a custom transformer to inject the data in the page alert. All of this was removed, in favor of a much simpler back only system. Here’s an example of a page alert in a Show Page, but this is the same in Form, Dashboard, Entity List, Embed and Command cases:

```php
class MyShow extends SharpShow
{
    // [...]
    
    protected function buildPageAlert(PageAlert $pageAlert): void
    {
        $pageAlert
            ->setLevelInfo()
            ->setMessage(function (array $data) {
                return $data['is_planned']
                    ? sprintf(
                        'This post is planned for publication, on %s',
                        $data['published_at'],
                    )
                    : null;
            });
    }
}
```

As you can see, this new `buildPageAlert()` method takes a `PageAlert` object as parameter to work with. You'll have access to the `$data` array returned by your `find()` or `getListData()` method, to inject dynamic data in your page alert if needed. Vue templates are no longer handed, as the page alert is now rendered on the back only.

## New validation system

The validation system was odd, for legacy reasons. 
In 9.x, it has been rewritten to be in phase with Laravel and to be more consistent:

- validation rules can now be defined in a `rules()` method of the form / command class,
- or with a `->validate($data, $rules)` call before update / store.
- The `$formValidatorClass` property usage, in a `SharpForm`, is now deprecated (you are strongly encouraged to migrate to the `rules()` method instead).

This version brings two huge benefits (besides the fact that it's clearer):

- the "delayed creation" thing is gone: the `{id}` parameter in a `SharpFormUploadField` storageBasePath isn't anymore an issue in creation case as Sharp will no longer call the `update()` method twice.
- Validation is now called AFTER data formatters, even in `SharpForm` (it was already the case with `Command`).

Breaking changes: the 8.x and below validation is still allowed, but deprecated. If you decide to migrate (and you should), pay attention to:

- remove special workarounds you may have done to handle the "delayed creation" thing,
- remove the `.text` suffix you may have added for `SharpFormEditorField` validation rules.

## Related models handing in custom transformers was fixed

This bug fix potentially brings a breaking change: if you were using a custom transformer to handle related models, you may have to update it.

Here’s code which will work in Sharp 8.x and below:

```php
$this
    ->setCustomTransformer('customer:name', fn ($value, $instance, $attribute) { 
        return $instance->customer->name;
    })
    ->transform(Order::find(1))
```

Is has to be rewritten like this in Sharp 9.x:

```php
$this
    ->setCustomTransformer('customer:name', fn ($value, $instance, $attribute) { 
        return $instance->name;
    })
    ->transform(Order::find(1))
```

The main difference is that the `$instance` parameter refers to the related model, not the main model anymore. To summarize:

In 8.x:
```php
$value: 'Joe Doe'
$instance: // the Order instance
$attribute: 'customer:name'
```

In 9.x:
```php
$value: 'Joe Doe'
$instance: // the **Customer** instance
$attribute: 'name'
```
