# Upgrading from 7.x to 8.x

## Get new assets, clear cache

This is true for every update: be sure to grab the latest assets and to clear the view cache:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=assets
php artisan view:clear
```

## implement `Show::delete($id)`, remove `Form::delete($id)`

In Sharp 8 we decided to finally move the instance deletion (meaning the Delete command) where it belongs: in the Show Page and the Entity List, and not in the Form as it was before for legacy reasons. This implies that a new Delete command is added in each instance of the Entity List and in the Show Page (of course, depending on authorizations).

This means that the Form `delete($id)` method is deprecated in v8 (and will be removed in 9.x), which may impact your code in two ways, depending on your situation:
- **All Show Pages must now define a `delete($id)` method** â€” it should be in most cases a copy / paste of the Form `delete($id)`. In this case, you should remove entirely the Form `delete($id)` method.
- For entities without Show Pages, you are not required to update your code because Sharp will detect and call the `Form::delete()` method as a workaround; the right way though (required in 9.x) would be to move the `delete()` method to your Entity List implementation.

For custom delete confirmations, you should call the new `SharpShow::configureDeleteConfirmationText(string $confirmationText)` and `SharpEntityList::configureDelete(?bool $hide = false, ?string $confirmationText = null)`.

Note: the (undocumented) `deleteSharpShow()` test assertion was also removed, use `deleteSharpEntityList()` or `deleteSharpShow()` instead.

## All deprecated methods were removed

Methods that were deprecated in 7.x were removed entirely. This includes:

- handling sharp's menu and entity in `sharp.php` config file (use [SharpMenu](../building-menu.md) and [SharpEntity](../entity-class.md) classes instead) 
- policies which does not extend `Code16\Sharp\Auth\SharpEntityPolicy` (see [Entity policies](../entity-authorizations.md))
- passing a closure for the `$collapsible` param of `ShowLayout::addEntityListSection` (pass a boolean)
- old test assertions for commands
- `SharpFormUploadField::setCroppable()` replaced with `SharpFormUploadField::setTransformable()` (see [Upload documentation](../form-fields/upload.md))

## Laravel 10+ and php 8.2+ required

It's not a breaking change but minimal requirements are now these.

## New way to build Entity List layout

`SharpEntityList`'s `buildListFields()`, `buildListLayout()` and `buildListLayoutForSmallScreens()` are now deprecated, in favor of an easier way to build the layout in a new `buildList()` method.

This means we can replace this code from 7.x:

```php
class PostList extends SharpEntityList
{
    protected function buildListFields(EntityListFieldsContainer $fieldsContainer): void
    {
        $fieldsContainer
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('cover'),
            )
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('title')
                    ->setLabel('Title'),
            )
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('author:name')
                    ->setLabel('Author')
                    ->setSortable(),
            )
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('published_at')
                    ->setLabel('Published at')
                    ->setSortable(),
            );
    }

    protected function buildListLayout(EntityListFieldsLayout $fieldsLayout): void
    {
        $fieldsLayout
            ->addColumn('cover', 1)
            ->addColumn('title', 4)
            ->addColumn('author:name', 3)
            ->addColumn('published_at', 4);
    }

    protected function buildListLayoutForSmallScreens(EntityListFieldsLayout $fieldsLayout): void
    {
        $fieldsLayout
            ->addColumn('title', 6)
            ->addColumn('published_at', 6);
    }
    // ...
}
```

With this in 8.x:

```php
class PostList extends SharpEntityList
{
    protected function buildList(EntityListFieldsContainer $fields): void
    {
        $fields
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('cover')
                    ->setWidth(1)
                    ->hideOnSmallScreens(),
            )
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('title')
                    ->setLabel('Title')
                    ->setWidth(4)
                    ->setWidthOnSmallScreens(6),
            )
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('author:name')
                    ->setLabel('Author')
                    ->setWidth(3)
                    ->hideOnSmallScreens()
                    ->setSortable(),
            )
            ->addField(
                EntityListField::make('published_at')
                    ->setLabel('Published at')
                    ->setWidth(4)
                    ->setWidthOnSmallScreens(6)
                    ->setSortable(),
            );
    }
    // ...
}
```

The old API is still supported to avoid breaking changes, but is deprecated and will be removed in 9.x. This new format is the only one documented in 8.x, here: [Building EntityList](../building-entity-list.md).

## Middleware declaration in config file

Sharp now uses the `middleware` key in the `sharp.php` config file to declare the middleware to be applied to all routes. In the unlikely case that you were injecting / replacing a middleware, you should now update this config key.
