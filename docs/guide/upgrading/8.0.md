# Upgrading from 7.x to 8.x

## Get new assets, clear cache

This is true for every update: be sure to grab the latest assets and to clear the view cache:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=assets
php artisan view:clear
```

## ???? Laravel 10+ and php 8.2+ required ????

It's not a BC, but still, minimal requirements are now these.

## All deprecated methods were removed

Methods that were deprecated in 7.x were removed entirely. This includes:

- handling sharp's menu and entity in `sharp.php` config file (use [SharpMenu](../building-menu.md) and [SharpEntity](../entity-class.md) classes instead) 
- policies which does not extend `Code16\Sharp\Auth\SharpEntityPolicy` (see [Entity policies](../entity-authorizations.md))
- passing a closure for the `$collapsible` param of `ShowLayout::addEntityListSection` (pass a boolean)
- old test assertions for commands
- `SharpFormUploadField::setCroppable()` replaced with `SharpFormUploadField::setTransformable()` (see [Upload documentation](../form-fields/upload.md))
