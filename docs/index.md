Sharp is a content management framework built for Laravel as a package, which provides great help to build a CMS section in a project with a clean UI and DX in mind. Sharp is driven by code: everything is manageable through a clean and documented PHP API, using Laravel conventions and coding style. It intends to preserve code adherence — the project should not have any knowledge of it — and is data-agnostic, meaning it does not have any expectations from the persistence layer.

Sharp for Laravel is actively maintained and developed, and is used in all kinds of projects, from content-driven websites to e-commerce platforms and API backends.

# About Sharp

Sharp is a long term project developed by [Code 16](https://code16.fr), a web agency based in France, since 2017. We use it in almost all our projects, and we are committed to maintaining and improving it over time.

Sharp 9 relies on Laravel 11, Tailwind, Inertia, Vue and Alpine.JS. So far we have not implemented any kind of sponsorship system, but we are open to discussing it in the future.
